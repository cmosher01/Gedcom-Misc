I've noticed Ancestry.com often adds SOUR citations randomly to
the wrong people. For example, I save a hint for a census citation
to the correct individual A, and not only does it assign that citation
to individual A, but also sometimes assigns it also to another
random individual B in the tree.

This script helps detect these errors by listing all sources that
refer to multiple people (unless they are in the same family).
This will typically result in a few false positives, but it should
still be useful to help find the real errors.
