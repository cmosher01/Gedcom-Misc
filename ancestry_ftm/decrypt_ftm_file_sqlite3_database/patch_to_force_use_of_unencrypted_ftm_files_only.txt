Clean install of FTM (2019 in this case), run it to make sure it's fully set up

Delete from Windows native cache:  "C:\Windows\assembly\NativeImages_v4.0.30319_64\FTM.Data.NextDB\"

"sn -Vr *" to prevent strong name (checksum) verification (may not be necessary)

We need to patch the .NET assembly: FTM.Data.NextDB.dll

To force FTM to work with unencrypted FTM files (and only unencrypted ones),
remove password calculation algorithm, and just set all passwords to empty strings.


Use https://hexed.it/


FTM.Data.NextDB:NextDbUtilHelper class, GetE method
(change one byte at offset B0FE):
from:
        /* 0x0000B0FE 3107         */ IL_0002: ble.s     IL_000B
to:
        /* 0x0000B0FE 3007         */ IL_0002: bgt.s     IL_000B



Then "Export" (to Downloads folder), and copy the file over top of
C:\Program Files\Family Tree Maker 2019\FTM.Data.NextDB.dll




To restore FTM to original, delete patched FTM.Data.NextDB.dll, then
use "Uninstall or change a program", right-click FTM and choose "Repair"



Note: you will need to decrypt all your FTM files (before the first time you
use them only). Use db.cs to do that (see decrypt_ftm_files.bat).
Then you need to manually patch the resulting SQLite database header
(see clean_descytped_ftm_db.sh bash script).
