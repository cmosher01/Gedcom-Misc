Footnotes
'THE NEW WERKES OF THE BODY OF THE CHURCH OF THE COLLEGE OF OUR LADY AND SAINT GEORGE WITHIN THE CASTELL OF WYNDESORE' – THE WILL OF REYNOLD BRAY, funding the completion of the Garter Chapel, St George's Windsor, widely acclaimed as a spectacular example of the last flowering of perpendicular architecture and recognised as one of the finest examples of Gothic architecture in England.

Bray had helped Henry VII to the throne in 1485, and from the time of Bosworth until his death in 1503 was 'one of the most powerful and omnicompetent of the king's councillors': 'his importance for the history of the reign of Henry VII cannot be explained conventionally in terms of office or title. It lies in his long and loyal service to the king's mother, Margaret Beaufort, and to Henry VII himself. To Polydore Vergil he was pater patriae, homo severus ("father of his country, a man of gravity"; Anglica historia, 128), with ready access to the king, and freedom to rebuke as well as to influence him' (M.M. Condon, ODNB).

Bray was elected a Knight of the Garter in 1501. At the time of his death two years later, the present St George's Chapel, begun by Edward IV in 1475, remained unfinished: 'Although the Quire had been built and fitted out with magnificent carved woodwork, the walls of the Nave reached only window-sill height and much remained to be done to bring the building to the state of regal grandeur that had been planned. The importance of the legacy bequeathed by Bray in his will to the subsequent history of St George's Chapel should not be underestimated. Following medieval tradition, Sir Reginald Bray, Knight of the Garter and close associate of Henry VII, had already paid during his lifetime for the construction of a chantry chapel (the Bray Chantry Chapel) to accommodate his "sinful body" after death and to ensure that prayers were offered there for his soul. However, it was the further instruction in his will that enabled the completion of the Nave in magnificent perpendicular Gothic style... Without this legacy, the Chapel might not have been completed for many decades and thereby might have lost the unity of design which is a key element of its magnificence. Bray's generosity enabled it to be "finished according and after the form and extent of the foundation thereof". Regular visitors to St George's Chapel will be aware of the many decorative features which commemorate Bray's association with the College of St George – one hundred and seventy-five depictions of his badge or rebus (a hemp-bray) in stone, iron, wood and glass adorn the Chapel in his memory' (Clare Rider, Archivist and Chapter Librarian, website of the College of St George, Windsor, www.stgeorges-windsor.org. But it was only with the proving of the will and grant of probate, as represented by our document, that Sir Reynold's bequest could be put into effect, and work on St George's Chapel begin.

The document was formerly in the possession of Herbert Goodall (1852-1907), an assistant to the architect George Edmund Street, and has passed to the present owners by inheritance and descent; and was until recently deposited at St George's.
Saleroom notices
We are grateful to Dr Clare Rider, Archivist and Chapter Librarian of St George's Chapel, Windsor, for pointing out the following amendments to our catalogue entry: This document is an exemplification (an official attested copy) of the will of Sir Reynold Bray, almost certainly in relation to a court case concerning the validity of Bray's final will. The Latin section comprises a statement by the Archbishop of Canterbury followed by depositions from witnesses present at Bray's deathbed and does not relate to the disposal of personal effects. The proving of the will allowed work on the chapel to resume, rather than begin, in 1511 – it had in fact begun in 1503. The loan of this document to the archive was for limited period only.
