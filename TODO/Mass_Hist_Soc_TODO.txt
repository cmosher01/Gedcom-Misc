John Winthrop journal: "History of New England," 1630-1649
Given to the Massachusetts Historical Society by Francis Bayard Winthrop in 1803 (vol. 1-2) and 1816 (vol. 3).
Gov. John Winthrop's journal describes events in the history of the Massachusetts Bay Colony from the sailing of the Arbella in Mar. 1630 until shortly before Winthrop's death. As the chief source of information on the colony's early history, Winthrop's journal was later used in the writings of historians such as William Hubbard, Cotton Mather, Thomas Prince, and Jeremy Belknap.
